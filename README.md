AI Joke Generator

This project is a Next.js application that generates jokes based on user-selected criteria (e.g., topic, tone, type) and allows for evaluating the generated jokes. The application leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5-turbo model to create and assess jokes.

Features

    Joke Generation: Users can generate jokes by selecting a topic, tone, and type of joke.
    Evaluation: Generated jokes can be evaluated for style accuracy and effectiveness based on the selected parameters.
    Customization: Adjust the "temperature" parameter to influence the creativity of generated jokes.

Tech Stack

    Frontend: Next.js, React
    Backend: Next.js API Routes, OpenAI API
    Styling: Tailwind CSS

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Node.js (version 14 or later)

Code Structure
Pages

    pages/index.tsx: Contains the main UI for generating and evaluating jokes. It includes dropdowns to select joke parameters and buttons for generating and evaluating jokes. Uses React state to manage the joke generation and evaluation processes.

API Routes

    /api/generate/route.ts: Handles POST requests to generate a joke. It accepts parameters like topic, tone, type, and temperature and returns a joke generated by the OpenAI API.

    /api/evaluate/route.ts: Handles POST requests to evaluate a generated joke. It assesses if the joke aligns with the intended tone and type, providing feedback on its effectiveness.

Usage

    Generate a Joke:
        Select a topic, tone, and joke type.
        Adjust the temperature slider to modify joke creativity.
        Click Generate Joke to create a new joke based on the selected parameters.

    Evaluate a Joke:
        After generating a joke, click Evaluate Joke to receive feedback on how well the joke matches the selected style.

Customization

    Topics, Tones, and Joke Types: You can modify the arrays in pages/index.tsx to add new joke options.
    Temperature: Adjust the "temperature" slider in the UI to experiment with joke creativity.
